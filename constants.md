# Constants

This chapter provides a list of constants that can be used in your formulas, along with their descriptions and values:

- `pi`: The mathematical constant π (pi), which is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter. Its approximate value is `3.14159`.
- `e`: The mathematical constant e, which is the base of the natural logarithm. Its approximate value is `2.71828`.
- `nan`: Stands for 'Not a Number'. It's a special floating-point value that represents undefined or unrepresentable numerical results, such as the result of 0/0.
- `inf`: Stands for 'Infinity'. It's a special floating-point value that represents positive infinity.
- `tau`: Tau (τ) is a mathematical constant equal to 2π, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius. Its approximate value is `6.28318`.
